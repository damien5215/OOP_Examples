**OOP NOTES**

Abstraction enables a class or method to conccentrate on the essentials of what it is doing and rely on the details being filled in at a later stage.

There are three ways of providing abstraction; inheritance, interfaces and abstract classes.

**An interface** is a completely "abstract class", which can only contain abstract methods and properties (with empty bodies).

To access interface methods the interface must be "implemented" by a class. A single class can implement multiple interfaces.

Like "abstract" classes interfaces cannot be used to creat objects.

Interface members are by default abstract and public.
